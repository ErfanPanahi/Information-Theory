# Information-Theory
In this repository, I initially attempt to calculate the entropy, G_k, using the probability transition matrix. Then, I proceed to compute and plot the average length of Huffman codes, G_k, and the coding gain for a memory source. Finally, I will derive the parameters of memoryless sources, X^k.
